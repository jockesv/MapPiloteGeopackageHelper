# WAL Mode Functionality Tests

The `TestWalFunctionality` class provides comprehensive testing of the new WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode feature in `CMPGeopackageCreateHelper.CreateGeoPackage()`.

## Test Coverage

### 1. `WalMode_EnabledGeoPackage_ShouldSupportConcurrentReadsWhileWriting`
- **Purpose**: Tests the primary benefit of WAL mode - concurrent read access during write operations
- **What it tests**:
  - Creates GeoPackage with WAL mode enabled
  - Verifies concurrent reader/writer connections work correctly
  - Demonstrates that readers can access data while writers have uncommitted transactions
  - Confirms WAL mode is properly reported in status messages

### 2. `WalMode_ComparedToNormalMode_ShouldShowDifferentJournalModes`
- **Purpose**: Verifies that WAL mode and normal mode produce different journal modes
- **What it tests**:
  - Creates two GeoPackages side-by-side (one WAL, one normal)
  - Confirms WAL GeoPackage uses "wal" journal mode
  - Confirms normal GeoPackage uses "delete" or "truncate" journal mode
  - Validates the mode difference is detectable via PRAGMA queries

### 3. `WalMode_CreateAndUseGeoPackage_ShouldMaintainDataIntegrity`
- **Purpose**: Ensures WAL mode doesn't break standard GeoPackage operations
- **What it tests**:
  - Creates GeoPackage with WAL mode and custom SRID (4326)
  - Creates layer and inserts multiple realistic data points (Swedish cities)
  - Verifies all data integrity after WAL operations
  - Confirms GeoPackage metadata structure remains intact
  - Validates status message reporting

### 4. `WalMode_PerformanceBenchmark_ShouldCompleteWithinReasonableTime`
- **Purpose**: Basic performance regression test for WAL mode
- **What it tests**:
  - Creates GeoPackage with WAL mode
  - Performs 100 point insertions
  - Measures total time and ensures it's within reasonable bounds (<10 seconds)
  - Verifies all data was written correctly
  - Provides performance metrics output

### 5. `WalMode_CheckpointAndCleanup_ShouldManageWalFilesCorrectly`
- **Purpose**: Tests WAL file management and checkpoint operations
- **What it tests**:
  - Creates GeoPackage with WAL mode
  - Generates WAL activity through multiple insertions
  - Checks for WAL auxiliary files (-wal, -shm)
  - Performs manual checkpoint operations
  - Verifies data accessibility after checkpoint
  - Demonstrates proper cleanup of WAL files

### 6. `WalMode_BackwardCompatibility_ExistingCodeShouldStillWork`
- **Purpose**: Ensures existing library functionality works unchanged with WAL mode
- **What it tests**:
  - Creates GeoPackage with WAL mode
  - Uses all existing helper methods (layer creation, point insertion, bulk insert, read operations)
  - Verifies complete end-to-end workflow with WAL mode
  - Confirms WAL mode is maintained throughout all operations
  - Tests backward compatibility with existing APIs

## Key Benefits Demonstrated

1. **Concurrency**: WAL mode allows concurrent readers during write operations
2. **Data Integrity**: All existing operations work correctly with WAL mode
3. **Performance**: WAL mode doesn't significantly impact operation speed
4. **File Management**: WAL auxiliary files are properly managed
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code works unchanged
6. **Easy Detection**: WAL mode can be verified via PRAGMA queries

## Test Design Principles

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests all major WAL functionality aspects
- **Real-world Data**: Uses realistic test data (Swedish cities with coordinates)
- **Error Handling**: Proper cleanup and error handling for all test scenarios
- **Performance Awareness**: Includes timing checks to prevent regressions
- **Isolation**: Each test is independent with proper setup/teardown
- **Verification**: Multiple verification points per test to ensure correctness

These tests provide confidence that the WAL mode feature works correctly and doesn't introduce regressions to existing functionality.
