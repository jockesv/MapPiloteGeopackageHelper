Start by checking out the project MapPiloteGeopackageHelperHelloWorld.

Note if you have an unknown Geopackage use the ProgramMPGeoPackageHelperSchemaBrowser to get the "schema" of the Geopackage 
that you then can use in your code. 

The other projects are used internally for development or for understanding the solution...
